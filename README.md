# rnn-based-time-series-classification
This project focuses on Time Series Classification task on a multivariate sensor dataset, aiming to pre- dict one of three classes using a Recurrent Neural Network. The adopted LSTM-based architec- ture was designed to handle class imbalance and high-dimensional input features.
